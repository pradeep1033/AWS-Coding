#To create the CodeCommit trigger, follow these steps:

#Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to the AWS CodeCommit service.
#Choose the repository that you want to add the trigger to.
#Click on the "Settings" tab, and then click on "Triggers".
#Click on the "Create trigger" button.
#Choose "Lambda function" as the trigger type.
#Choose the Lambda function that you created earlier from the dropdown list.
#In the "Branch names" field, enter the name of the branch you want to track, for example, "main".
#Click "Create".
#Now, whenever a new commit is pushed to the specified branch of the CodeCommit repository, the Lambda function will be triggered,
#and the committed files will be uploaded to the specified S3 bucket with the specified folder location.
