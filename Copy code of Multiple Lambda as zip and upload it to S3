#Here is an example of how you can use the boto3 library in Python to download the code of multiple Lambda functions, create a zip file with the code, and then upload the zip file to a specified S3 bucket:

import boto3
import zipfile

# Create a boto3 client for AWS Lambda
lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')

# Create a boto3 client for AWS S3
s3 = boto3.client('s3')

# List of function names to download
function_names = ['function_1', 'function_2', 'function_3']

# S3 bucket name to upload the zip files
bucket_name = 'my-s3-bucket'

# Loop through each function name
for function_name in function_names:
